# My First Rust Project

This is my first project using Rust.  
I'm currently learning Rust, and this project is part of my exercises to get familiar with its concepts and fundamentals.

## Description

In this project, I've implemented some simple functionalities, such as converting temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius.  
The goal of this project is to practice using input/output operations, control flow, and writing simple functions in Rust.

## Notes

- I'm learning basic Rust concepts such as memory management, function usage, and control flow.
- I'm also using Git and GitHub for version control and to share my code.

I hope to succeed in my journey of learning Rust!
